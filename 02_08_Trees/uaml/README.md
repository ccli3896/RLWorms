# Uncertainty-Aware Machine Learning 

**uaml** is a Python module for easy and effective uncertainty-aware machine learning based on probabilistic ensembles and the Jensenâ€“Shannon divergence. Currently, it is built on top of scikit-learn and supports all probabilistic base classifiers. **Important: work in progress.**

## Installation 

### Dependencies 

Following modules are required:

* NumPy 
* Scikit-learn

### User installation

## Basic usage

```python
import numpy as np

from sklearn.svm import SVC
from uaml.classifier import UAClassifier

# Some example data
X_train, X_test, y_train = np.random.randn(1000,100), np.random.randn(100,100), np.random.randint(0,5,1000)

# Use SVC as base (probabilistic) estimator
estm = SVC(gamma=2, C=1, probability=True) 

# Constuct and fit an uncertainty-aware classifier with 500 estimators and parallelize over 5 cores 
clf = UAClassifier(estm, mc_sample_size=0.5, n_mc_samples=500, n_jobs=5)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Obtain predictions by means of majority voting and calculate aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty
yhat = clf.predict(X_test, avg=True)
ua, ue = clf.get_uncertainty(X_test)
```
