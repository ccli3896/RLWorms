# Agents folder

First three lines in order in manuscript: 281, 301, 352 respectively. 20 agents per ensemble trained for 20 epochs.

Last four lines in manuscript:
446, 336, 437, 73 respectively. Higher variance during training in these lines (Fig. 4 in manuscript) so 30 agents per ensemble and visually inspected agents to decide when to stop training, for non-trivial and symmetric policies (see Methods for details).

Policy plots included for each agent. 

Overall plot: location of tested policy, with center plot at target location.

Subplots: Y-axis: relative head angle from -180 (top) to 180 degrees. X-axis: body angle relative to target from -180 (left) to 180 degrees.
